# Multiple temperatures converter

A converter between any of the scales: Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin, Rankine, Delisle, Newton, Réaumur, Rømer from any direction. Built in Python 3+

## Installing / Getting started

Python Interpreter 3+ is required in order to compile the code, you may build this into an executable through other means if you wish. Standard compilation is all that is needed.

Once the code is executed, you will be provided with a prompt asking you what scale you want to convert from, then another prompt asking you for the temperature to convert. The output will be all the temperature scales supported.
